Assignment 1 - Implement a Singly Linked List and a Circular Queue

Design two separate classes in C++:
<br>

1. Singly Linked List <br>
> ● Support insertion at the front, insertion at the end, deletion of a given value, search for a value, and printing all elements. <br>
> ● Write a main function that demonstrates all supported operations on the linked list.

<br> 

2. Circular Queue Using Array
> ● Create a CircularQueue class using a fixed-size array and two pointers (front and rear).<br> 
> ● Implement enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, and printQueue methods.<br> 
> ● Write a main function that demonstrates enqueuing, dequeuing, and edge case handling (overflow/underflow) for the circular queue.<br>

<br> 

### Requirements:
> ● Use clear class structures and separate implementations for each data structure.<br>
> ● Do not use standard library containers like std::list or std::queue for the main logic—you must create the underlying structure yourself.<br>
> ● Well-commented code and basic error handling are expected.<br>

<br> 

### Extension (Optional for Bonus):
> ● Implement a function to reverse the entire linked list in place.<br>
> ● Add a peek function to your circular queue that returns the value at the front without removing it.<br>
