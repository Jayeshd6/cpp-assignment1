Assignment 1 - Implement a Singly Linked List and a Circular Queue

Design two separate classes in C++:
1. Singly Linked List
● Support insertion at the front, insertion at the end, deletion of a given
value, search for a value, and printing all elements.
● Write a main function that demonstrates all supported operations on the
linked list.
2. Circular Queue Using Array
● Create a CircularQueue class using a fixed-size array and two pointers
(front and rear).
● Implement enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, and printQueue methods.
● Write a main function that demonstrates enqueuing, dequeuing, and edge
case handling (overflow/underflow) for the circular queue.
Requirements:
● Use clear class structures and separate implementations for each data structure.
● Do not use standard library containers like std::list or std::queue for the main
logic—you must create the underlying structure yourself.
● Well-commented code and basic error handling are expected.
Extension (Optional for Bonus):
● Implement a function to reverse the entire linked list in place.
● Add a peek function to your circular queue that returns the value at the front
without removing it.
